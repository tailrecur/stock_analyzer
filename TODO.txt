"current.adjusted_no_of_shares < previous.adjusted_no_of_shares" might be faulty incase of splits and bonuses. equity capital might be better.

EV = (Market Cap + Debt + preferred Shares - Cash & Cash Equivalents)
1. EVtoSales =  EV / Annual Sales. lower is better. Compare to sectoral average

EBITDA = Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation  
2. EV/EBITDA compare to sectoral average. higher is better

3. PBT Margin. Compare to companies' past values. Higher is better.    PBT Margin = PBT / Net Sales % 

4. ROE (RONW) = Net Income / Shareholder Equity. Compare to past values and sectoral average. Higher is better

5. ROCE = (EBIT - Non-Operating Income) / (Total Assets - Current Liabilites) = Operating Profit / Total Funds . Should be higher than the rate at which the company borrows. Compare same as ROE

6. Debt/Equity - Lower is better. Compare to sectoral average.

Net Current Asset Value (NCAV) = current assets - Current Liabilities - Long-term debt - Preferred Stock
7. NCAV/Share usage CTP <= 67% of NCAVPS

8. Price / Book value. compare to sectoral average. lower is better

9. Acid Test Ratio = (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Short term investments) / Current liabilities = (Currents Assets + Investments) / Current Liabilities

Apply formula noting which price-dependent formula passes/fails.
If there are any price-dependent formula which fails,
decrement the price and evaluate these formulae again
Whenever a formula passes, save that price-formula pair
Continue till all formula have been evaluated,

low =0, high = closing_price
all formulae which pass at 0, move to passable, throw out all which fail
for all in high_bucket, apply at average price,
